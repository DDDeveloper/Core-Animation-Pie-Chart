# Core Animation Pie Chart

### Created by Brian Coyner (2011,2012,2013)

#### Requirements

- Xcode 5.0, iOS 7 

This is a simple Pie Chart view built using Core Animation. The purpose of this app is to demonstrate a technique
for animating arc (i.e. wedges) of a pie chart.

The pie chart contains the following features:

- add new slices (animated)
- remove selected slice (animated)
- update existing pie values (animated)
- interactive slice selection (tap and/ or move your finger)

The view uses a data source (number of slices, slice value) and delegate (selection tracking)
